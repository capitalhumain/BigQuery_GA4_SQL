## Quick Pull in BigQuery with BigFunctions

Easily query GA4 data in BigQuery using **[BigFunctions]([url](https://unytics.io/bigfunctions/bigfunctions/create_ga4_views/))**, a set of pre-built table functions that simplify data analysis. Follow these steps to set it up:

### **How to Use BigFunctions for GA4 Queries**
1. **Create a Dataset**  
   Prepare a dataset to store table functions:
   ```sql
   CREATE SCHEMA `your_project.ga4_bigquery_queries`;
   ```

2. **Generate Table Functions**  
   Run the `create_ga4_views` function to generate reusable table functions:  
   ```sql
   CALL bigfunctions.us.create_ga4_views(
     'your_project.analytics_dataset',   -- Replace with GA4 dataset
     'your_project.ga4_bigquery_queries' -- Destination for table functions
   );
   ```

3. **Query Data**  
   Use the generated table functions to pull GA4 data with date ranges:  
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `your_project.ga4_bigquery_queries`.event_scope__flatten_events('2024-11-01', '2024-12-01');
   ```

## Collaboration Guidelines

This repository is open-source and welcomes contributions from the community. Below are the collaboration guidelines and standards to maintain consistency and usability.

---

### **Contribution Standards**

1. **Declare Date Ranges:**  
   Always declare date ranges explicitly in the query using `DECLARE` statements for `start_date` and `end_date`. This makes the queries reusable and easy to customize for various date ranges.

2. **Redacted Table References:**  
   Use generic, redacted table names like `project.dataset.table_*` instead of specific project or dataset names. This ensures the query remains accessible and reusable across different environments.

3. **Descriptive Commit Names and Messages:**  
   - **Commit Name:** Provide a concise and meaningful name summarizing the query's purpose. For example, *"CTR vs. Position Correlation"*.
   - **Commit Message:** Offer a detailed description of what the query does and its practical applications. If applicable, explain any specific features or optimizations added.
