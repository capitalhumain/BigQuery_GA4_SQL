## Quick Pull in BigQuery with BigFunctions

Easily query GA4 data in BigQuery using **[BigFunctions]([url](https://unytics.io/bigfunctions/bigfunctions/create_ga4_views/))**, a set of pre-built table functions that simplify data analysis. Follow these steps to set it up:

### **How to Use BigFunctions for GA4 Queries**
1. **Create a Dataset**  
   Prepare a dataset to store table functions:
   ```sql
   CREATE SCHEMA `your_project.ga4_bigquery_queries`;
   ```

2. **Generate Table Functions**  
   Run the `create_ga4_views` function to generate reusable table functions:  
   ```sql
   CALL bigfunctions.us.create_ga4_views(
     'your_project.analytics_dataset',   -- Replace with GA4 dataset
     'your_project.ga4_bigquery_queries' -- Destination for table functions
   );
   ```

3. **Query Data**  
   Use the generated table functions to pull GA4 data with date ranges:  
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `your_project.ga4_bigquery_queries`.event_scope__flatten_events('2024-11-01', '2024-12-01');
   ```
